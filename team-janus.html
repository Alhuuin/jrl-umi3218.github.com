<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>JANUS is a bi-located team that gathers expertise from the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the French National Centre for Scientific Research CNRS (CNRS), namely the Humanoid Research Group at the Intelligent Systems Research Institute (IS) for AIST, the CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL), and the LIRMM, Interactive Digital Human laboratory in Montpellier. All these teams have extensive experience in humanoid robotics, haptics, brain computer interfaces, control, telerobotics and telepresence, embodiment and physical avatars. AIST is the co-developer with Kawada industries of the world renown HRP humanoid families and the main developer of the HRP Miim, the first effectively walking geminoid called cybernetic human and has extensive expertise in humanoid robotics. CNRS posses the only HRP-4 humanoid present in Europe. CNRS and AIST to some extent, were also partners of the EU Virtual Embodiment and Robotic Re-Embodiment (VERE) project where a telepresence embodiment station featuring advanced multi-modal feedback decodes the participantâ€™s motor intentions at the EEG brain level to control humanoid robots even over large distances. CNRS with AIST joint efforts in the last EU Comanoid project where humanoid robots are envisioned to work in large-scale aeronautics manufacturing.</p>
