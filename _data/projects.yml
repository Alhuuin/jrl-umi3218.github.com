<p>In Roman mythology, Janus represents the transition from the past to the future, like the one we are seeing today with new technologies. It also represents bridges and connections, like the ones we are building between humans and robots: two entities into the same body.</p>

<p>JANUS is a bi-located team that gathers expertise from the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the French National Centre for Scientific Research CNRS (CNRS), namely CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL) and LIRMM, Interactive Digital Human laboratory in Montpellier. These teams have extensive experience in humanoid robotics, haptics, brain computer interfaces, control, telerobotics and telepresence, embodiment and physical avatars. AIST is the co-developer with Kawada industries of the world renown HRP humanoid families and the main developer of the HRP Miim, the first effectively walking geminoid called cybernetic human and has extensive expertise in humanoid robotics. CNRS posses the only HRP-4 humanoid present in Europe. CNRS and AIST to some extent, were also partners of the EU Virtual Embodiment and Robotic Re-Embodiment (VERE) project where a telepresence embodiment station featuring advanced multi-modal feedback decodes the participant’s motor intentions at the EEG brain level to control humanoid robots even over large distances. CNRS with AIST joint efforts in the last EU Comanoid project where humanoid robots are envisioned to work in large-scale aeronautics manufacturing.</p>

<b>Why are we competing in ANA Avatar XPRIZE?</b>

<p>Our main mission is to create and advance knowledge for the well-being of humanity and society. Challenging competitions like ANA Avatar XPRIZE are the technological catalyzers for new ideas and technologies. Furthermore, the Covid19 outbreak highlighted the need for such an avatar technology in healthcare services, frail persons homes, as well as many other economical and societal sectors.</p>

<b>Which have been the biggest challenges?</b>

<p>The biggest challenge is the seamless integration of existing and new technologies into a reliable architecture. Particularly, the transparency of the teleoperation is extremely challenging in anthropomorphic robotic systems. When using a humanoid robot as an avatar, the sensory feedback scales in complexity. For example, how do you provide the dynanmic balance awareness to the human operator? How do you alleviate the lack of degrees of freedom? How do you conceive a reliable loco-manipulation shared control?</p>

<p>Visadapt is an exploratory project aiming at creating a new camera of highly non-linear field-of-view, enabled by soft robot mirror. The interest is to automatically adapt the resolution of the camera to the scene content, i.e. low in uniform or not interesting areas but high in informative areas or interesting regarding the application (e.g. body, face, geometric features, etc).</p>
    <h4>The goals are:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>To design a new mirror material capable of deformations while keeping high quality reflection</li>
      <li>To model and compute efficiently the desired shape of the mirror soft robot as function of a field-of-view distribution</li>
			<li>To control the deformation from visual input</li>
    </ul>
A realistic simulator and a first prototype are the expected results.

  <p>COMANOID aims at deploying humanoid robots to achieve non-added value tasks that have been identified by Airbus Group in aircraft assembly operations. The project focuses on showing precise accessibility (namely into areas where wheeled robots cannot be deployed) through whole body multi-contact planning motion with advanced embedded 3D dense SLAM localization and visuo-force servoing capabilities. Because the robots evolve in human worker co-localized spaces, safety issues will be specifically accounted for. The results of COMANOID will be showcased in a 1:1 scale demonstrator of a real aircraft using two humanoid robots: the HRP-4 position controlled humanoid robot provided by CNRS partner and the TORO torque controlled humanoid robot provided by DLR partner.</p>
    <h4>Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>To investigate the deployment of humanoid robots solutions in Airbus assembly operations that are laborious and inaccessible for wheeled platforms.</li>
      <li>To achieve Human-robot safe and operationally efficient collaboration.</li>

  description: "<p>Teaching two-legged robots a stable, robust “human” way of walking – this is the goal of the international research project KoroiBot, which is named after Koroibos of Elis, the first recorded Olympic champion in history. KoroiBot is funded by the European Union from October 2013 on for three years and gathers an interdisciplinary consortium from the areas of robotics, mathematics and cognitive sciences.</p>
  <p>Whether as rescuers in disaster areas, household helps or as “colleagues” in modern work environments: there are numerous possible areas of deployment for humanoid robots in the future. One of the major challenges on the way is to enable robots to move on two legs in different situations, without falling – even in unknown rough terrain and under possible perturbations.</p>
    <p>In the KoroiBot project, we will study the way humans walk e.g. on stairs and slopes, on soft and slippery ground or over beams and seesaws, and create mathematical models. Besides developing new optimization and learning methods for walking on two legs, we  aim to implement them in practice on real robots. In addition, the research results are to flow into planning new design principles for the next generation of robots.</p>
    <p>Besides the targeted use in robotics, we expect possible applications of the methods in medicine, e.g. for controlling intelligent artificial limbs, designing and controlling exoskeletons as well as in computer animation and in game design.</p>

    <p>Our brain can readily learn to control new actions with our effectors/limbs, but can it also learn to control new limbs in addition to our current ones? Answering this question will clarify an individual brain’s neuronal limits, for functional augmentation with brain-machine interface (BMI) systems and of plasticity after brain damage. This JSPS (Kakenhi 'houga')multi-disciplinary project with the University of Electro-communication in Tokyo will provide a crucial understanding of the <i>unused capabilities</i> of the human brain in regard to effector control and will enable a human to use this capability to incorporate an additional artificial limb naturally into his body schema.</p>
