  abstract  = {We present a novel approach to plan foot placements for a humanoid robot according to kinematic tasks. In this approach, the foot placements are determined by the continuous deformation of a robot motion including a locomotion phase according to the desired tasks. We propose to represent the motion by a virtual kinematic tree composed of a kinematic model of the robot and articulated foot placements. This representation allows us to formulate the motion deformation problem as a classical inverse kinematics problem on a kinematic tree. We first provide details of the basic scheme where the number of footsteps is given in advance and illustrate it with scenarios on the robot HRP-2. Then we propose a general criterion and an algorithm to adapt the number of footsteps progressively to the kinematic goal. The limits and possible extensions of this approach are discussed last.},
