  abstract  = {This paper presents a method of computing efficient and natural-looking motions for humanoid robots walking on varied terrain. It uses a small set of high-quality motion primitives (such as a fixed gait on flat ground) that have been generated offline. But rather than restrict motion to these primitives, it uses them to derive a sampling strategy for a probabilistic, sample-based planner. Results in simulation on several different terrains demonstrate a reduction in planning time and a marked increase in motion quality.}
