  abstract  = {We present a concept of novel self-reconfigurable robotic system made of homogeneous autonomous robotic modules. Each robotic module has only two DOF, however a group of this module is able to change its connective configuration by changing their local connections. A cluster of the modules, thus can metamorphose into arbitrary configuration according to the surrounding environment or desired specification. Not only this ability of structural metamorphosis, the combined modules have functionality of robotic system which is capable of generating complicated motion.},
