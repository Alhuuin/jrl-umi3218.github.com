  abstract  = {The M-TRAN is a modular robot capable of both three-dimensional self-reconfiguration and whole body locomotion. Introducing regularity in allowed structures reduced difficulties of its reconfiguration problems. Several locomotion patterns in various structures were designed systematically using a CPG controller model and GA optimization. Then they were verified by experimentation. Results showed a feasible scenario of operation with multiple M-TRAN modules, which is presented herein, including metamorphosis of a regular structure, generation of walkers from the structure, walker locomotion, and reassembling of walkers to the structure. Keywords: Modular robot; Autonomous distributed system; Self-reconfiguration; Metamorphosis},
