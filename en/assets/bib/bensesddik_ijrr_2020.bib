  abstract  = {This paper presents a new dataset of ultra-wide field of view images with accurate ground truth, called PanoraMIS. The dataset covers a large spectrum of panoramic cameras (catadioptric, twin-fisheye), robotic platforms (wheeled, aerial and industrial robots), and testing environments (indoors and outdoors), and it is well suited to rigorously validate novel image-based robot-motion estimation algorithms, including visual odometry, visual SLAM, and deep learning-based methods. PanoraMIS and the accompanying documentation is publicly available on the Internet for the entire research community.},
