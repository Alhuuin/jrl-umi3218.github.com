  abstract  = {This paper presents a whole body teleoperation system for a humanoid robot integrating operator\textquotesingle s intention and the robot\textquotesingle s autonomy. Instead of giving command to all the joints of the body, we have been proposing a switching command based teleoperation system of which the operator selects only the necessary points of the robot\textquotesingle s body to manipulate depending on the required tasks. We have also proposed a whole body motion generation method, which satisfies both, and the desired movement of specific points of the robot\textquotesingle s body and the robot\textquotesingle s balance constraint. This paper first explains the concept of the proposed teleoperation system and the autonomous functions for maintaining balance and expanding the reachable area of a humanoid robot. Then the paper reports on the experimental results using the proposed methods to teleoperate a real humanoid robot HRP-1S to perform balanced whole body motions satisfying operator\textquotesingle s input command.}
