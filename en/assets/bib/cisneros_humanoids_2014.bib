  abstract  = {This paper describes a generalized approach for compensating just the required yaw moment of a humanoid robot about the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) while performing an arbitrary motion, in order to prevent unwanted / unexpected yaw rotations. This is done by modifying the motion of any set of joints with low priority tasks that can be arbitrarily selected before-hand. Finally, some simulation results are provided, which intend to show the validity of this approach.}
