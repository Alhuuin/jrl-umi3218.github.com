  abstract  = {We propose a novel framework for zero-shot learning of topic-dependent language models, which enables the learning of language models corresponding to specific topics for which
no language data is available. To realize zeroshot learning, we exploit the semantic compositionality of the target topics. Complex topics are normally composed of several elementary semantic components. We found that the language model that corresponds to a particular
topic can be approximated with a linear combination of language models corresponding to elementary components of the target topics.
On the basis of the findings, we propose simple methods of zero-shot learning. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we apply the methods to the problem of generating natural language descriptions of short Kinect videos of simple human actions.}
