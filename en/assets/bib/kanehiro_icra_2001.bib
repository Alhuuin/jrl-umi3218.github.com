  abstract  = {In this paper, the developmental software environment for humanoids is introduced. This environment has the following features: 1) a hardware concealment function which saves the trouble with hardware improvements; 2) an incremental expansion function which supports a long-term development by many developers; and 3) a centralised management of body information which enables the robots to share software among different bodies. These features are realized by the plug-in architecture, the universal robot model and its compilers. Using plug-ins enables one to accumulate functions developed by different developers and to switch computer interfaces of the robot body. The universal robot model and compilers promote the use of external software and share software modules among different bodies.}
