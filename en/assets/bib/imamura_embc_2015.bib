  abstract  = {In this study, we propose an estimation model of lumbar load, which is a factor in lumbar disorders. Our proposed method uses a musculoskeletal model with elastic elements between the vertebral bodies, and simulates the inter- vertebral disk pressure and the displacement of the vertebral bodies simultaneously.}
