  abstract  = {In this paper, we generate the biped gait of a humanoid robot that looks like a human\textquotesingle s one. To generate the human like motion, we first capture walking motion of a human. Then, we analyze the captured data and obtain several information such as the relationship between the step length and waist height etc. We consider applying these informations to the real humanoid robot. Also, when the human walks, the sway of the waist is smaller than most of the humanoid robot\textquotesingle s one. By compensating the angular momentum of the robot and by modifying the ZMP trajectory, we show that sway of the robot\textquotesingle s waist can be smaller. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation and experimental results.}
