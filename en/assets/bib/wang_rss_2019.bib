  abstract  = {Almost all known robots fear impacts. Unlike humans, robots keep guarded motions to near zero-velocity prior to establishing contacts with their surroundings. This significantly slows down robotic tasks involving physical interaction. Two main ingredients are necessary to remedy this limitation: impactfriendly hardware design, and impact-friendly controllers. Our work focuses on the controller aspect. Task-space controllers formulated as quadratic programming (QP) are widely used in roboticstogeneratemodularandreactivemotionforalargerange of task specifications under various constraints. We explicitly introduce discrete impact dynamics model into the QP-based controllers to generate robot motions that are robust to impactinduced state jumps in the joint velocities and joint torques. Our simulations, validate that our proposed impact-friendly QP controller is robust to contact impacts, shall they be expected or not.Therefore,wecanexploititforestablishingcontactswithhigh velocities, and explicitly generate task-purpose impulsive forces.}
