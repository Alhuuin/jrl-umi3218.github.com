  abstract  = {We describe the concept and first prototype of a novel mechatronic design of a robotic gripper, which aims at being mounted on a humanoid robot to achieve firm (i.e. locked) and robust grasps. Such grasps could ideally support complex multi-contact motions, such as ladder climbing, or manipulation of complex tools, with energy efficiency. For this purpose, we propose a solution by designing a smart self-locking underactuated mechanism mounted in parallel to actuators to be triggered automatically when the desired grasp is achieved. This design leverages adjustable power distribution between the gripper and the brake through a differential gear. The advantages of adaptive, firm grasping, and energy-saving capabilities of our gripper are experimentally demonstrated by a prototype gripper.}
