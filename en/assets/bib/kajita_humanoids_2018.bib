  abstract  = {We have realized a biped walking control based on the spatially quantized dynamics (SQD) which discretizes a continuous system by a constant unit length along the walk direction. By using SQD, a prescribed sagittal kinematic pattern can be transformed into dynamically consistent robot motion in real-time. The lateral motion is generated by preview control which uses future ZMP predicted by SQD at every control cycle. A successful biped walk of HRP-2Kai with fully stretched knees and long stride was realized by the proposed method.}
