  abstract  = {We have been doing research about visual SLAM, 3D measurements and robot controls by using images obtained through fisheye lenses. Though fisheye lens is non-single viewpoint (NSVP), we established the 3D analysis methods based on single viewpoint (SVP) model. In this paper, we call such substitution SVP for NSVP as " SVP approximation " and evaluate 3D analysis errors caused by the SVP approximation in the case using two different types of fisheye lenses.}
