  abstract  = {A biped walking pattern generator which allows an additional ZMP control (auxiliary ZMP) is presented. An auxiliary ZMP is realized by an inverse system added to a pattern generator based on the ZMP preview control. To compensate the effect of the auxiliary ZMP, we apply virtual time shifting of the reference ZMP. As an application of the proposed method, a walking control on uneven terrain is simulated. The simulated robot can walk successfully by changing its walking speed as the side effect of the auxiliary ZMP control}
