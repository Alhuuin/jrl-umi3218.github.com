  abstract  = {This article explains a control system, which stabilizes running biped robot HRP-2LR. The robot uses prescribed running pattern calculated by resolved momentum control, and a running controller stabilizes the system against disturbances. The running controller consists of posture stabilization, inverted pendulum stabilization, contact torque control, impact absorbing control, foot vertical force control and torque distribution control. Applying the proposed controller, HRP-2LR could successfully run with average speed of 0.16(m/s) repeating flight phase of 0.06 (s) and support phase of 0.3 (s).}
