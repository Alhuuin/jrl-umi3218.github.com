  abstract  = {An accurate and convenient method of measuring human movements is essential for human motion analysis. In recent days, several types of motion capture system became available. Since each measurement technology has both merits and demerits, their suitable choice depends on each application or varying situations. Therefore, it is important that the motion analysis software should flexibly select and be connected to several measurement systems simultaneously according to target applications. This paper presents a software designed to manage different motion capture systems and to perform the musculoskeletal analysis. It allow us not only to get data from different systems but also give us the capability of synchronizing/merging their data.}
