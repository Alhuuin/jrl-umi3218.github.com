  abstract  = {We discuss a ZMP-based running pattern generation for a biped robot equipped with toe springs. Our biped robot HRP-2LT has twelve active DoFs for its legs and two passive DoFs for its toes. The trajectory of the center of mass is designed to realize the specified running motion and the foot trajectories are determined to get proper spring action at lift off phases. They are interpreted into joint angles by using the resolved momentum control. By the simulation and the preliminary experiment, it is shown that the toe springs are effectively used for running and hopping.}
