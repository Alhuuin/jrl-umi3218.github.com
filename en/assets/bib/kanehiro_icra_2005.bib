  abstract  = {This paper proposes a method for a humanoid robot to generate 3D model of the environment using a stereo vision, find a movable space using it and plan feasible locomotion online. The model is generated by an accumulation of 3D grid maps which are made from the range data of the field of view obtained by a correlation based stereo vision. The locomotion is planned by an online whole body pattern generator which can modify robot’s waist height, an upper body posture and so on according to the size of the movable space.}
