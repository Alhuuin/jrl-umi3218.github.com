  abstract  = {In the present paper, we propose a one-shot scanning system consisting of multiple projectors and cameras for dense entire shape acquisition of a moving object. One potential application of the proposed system is to capture a moving object at a high frame rate. Since the patterns used for one-shot scanning are usually complicated, and the patterns interfere with each other if they are projected onto the same object, it is difficult to use multiple sets of patterns for entire shape acquisition. In addition, the overlapped areas of each object have gaps and errors are accumulated. As such, merged shapes are usually noisy and inconsistent. In order to address this problem, we propose a one-shot shape reconstruction method using a projector to project a static pattern of parallel lines of one or two colors. Since each projector projects only parallel lines with a small number of colors, these patterns are easily decomposed and detected even if the patterns are projected multiple times onto the same object. We also propose a multi-view reconstruction algorithm for the projector-camera system. In the experiment, we built a system consisting of six projectors and six cameras, and dense shapes of entire objects were successfully reconstructed.},
