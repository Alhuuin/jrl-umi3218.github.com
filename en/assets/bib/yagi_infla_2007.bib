  abstract  = {The diagnostic time required for a full, 8-hour video capsule endoscopy is usually between 45 and 120 min. The aim of this work is to evaluate the diagnostic time required when applying a method that adaptively controlls the image display rate. The advantage of the method is that the sequence can be played at high speed in stable smooth sequences to save time and then decreased at sequences where there are sudden rough changes, in order to assess suspicious findings detail. In this paper, this method is examined under real conditions: 10 sequences were independently evaluated by 4 medical doctors. The methods of evaluation include: 1) the time required for reading a sequence, 2) the percentage of abnormal regions accurately found, and 3) the manipulations of the evaluating physicians. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces diagnostic time to around 10 \pm  1.5\% length of the sequence and is of valuable assistance to medical doctors.},
