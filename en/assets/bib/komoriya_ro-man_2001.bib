  abstract  = {A mobile manipulator will be a practical robot in our daily life environment. In order for the robot to fit the environment, an omnidirectional mobile function and posture stabilization function of the mobile base should be necessary. In this paper the construction of omnidirectional mobile mechanism and its kinematics for the control are described. The implementation of a real-time reaction force sensor for the posture stabilization and its basic experimental results are reported.}
