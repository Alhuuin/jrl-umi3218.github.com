  abstract  = {This study examines the immediate effect of a walking-assistive powered wear on human gait. The device is small and lightweight with a wire-driven assistive system. It aims to increase users\textquotesingle  activity levels, and extend their healthy life-span by exerting a musculoskeletal rehabilitation effect. The powered wearable device assists the hip joints by controlling the timing of the wire actuation during walking. The gait motions of 11 middle-aged and elderly persons wearing the powered assist were measured and kinematically analyzed. The movements of the hip joints were significantly increased in eight of the 11 participants. The device is mainly intended to reduce physical fatigue, but might also improve the gait.}
