  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a strategy for a dual-arm robot to pick up a specific part of clothing with one hand while holding the item of clothing with its other hand. Due to the large deformability of clothing, the handling requirements differ from those required for the handling of rigid objects. In the case of holding a specific part of clothing, large deformation leads to a large variety of positions and orientations of the target part, requiring flexibility of both visual recognition and motion control. On the other hand, since the clothing can flexibly curve over the hand, a relatively large range of suitable actions is allowed for grasping the clothing. By considering these characteristics, the following three-stage strategy is proposed. First, the state of the clothing is recognized from visual observation of the clothing using a deformable-model [1]. Then, the theoretically optimal position and orientation of the hand for handling a specific part of the clothing is calculated based on the recognition results. Finally, the position and orientation of the hand is modified by considering the executable motion range of the dual arms. Preliminary experimental results using actual observations of a humanoid robot were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.}
