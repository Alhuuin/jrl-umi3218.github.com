  abstract  = {A distributed reconfiguration method is proposed for a 3-D reconfigurable structure, com- posed of many identical mechanical units. The method aims to enable the structure to transform itself into desired structure from an arbitrary initial configuration. The proposed method is im- plemented in such a way that each unit has identical software as well as hardware, so that any unit can play any role in the system. It is also featured by a stochastic relaxation process, which allows the system to converge to a given target structure by searching for a proper unit motion over many degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the method is extended for the structure to reconfig- ure itself dynamically according to the environment. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by computer simulations.},
