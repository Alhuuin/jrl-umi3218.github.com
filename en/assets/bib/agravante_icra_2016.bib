  abstract  = {This paper is about the design of humanoid walking pattern generators to be used for physical collaboration. A particular use case is a humanoid robot helping a human to carry large and/or heavy objects. To do this, we construct a reduced model which takes into account physical interaction. This is used in a model predictive control framework to generate separate behaviors for being a follower or a leader. The approach is then validated both on simulation and on the HRP-4 humanoid robot.}
