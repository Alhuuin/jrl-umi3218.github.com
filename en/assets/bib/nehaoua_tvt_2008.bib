  abstract  = {This paper presents a driving simulation which aim is twofold: (i) investigate the possibility to reduce motion clear-ance in order to achieve compact and low cost driving simulators, and (ii) evaluate multimodal and immersive virtual reality motion restitution in platooning driving. The choice has been made for a driving simulator having at least two degrees of freedom. These consist of the longitudinal displacement and seat rotations. The simulator is also equipped with force feedback steering wheel for virtual drive assistance. These components are gathered on a serial kinematics type platform in order to facilitate control scheme, and avoid the architecture complexity. A comparative study was made to devise a motion cueing strategy, taking into account both psychophysical and technological constraints. Experimentations were carried out for several cases combinations of longitudinal displacement and seat rotations.
