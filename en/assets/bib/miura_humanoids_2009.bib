  abstract  = {This paper presents preliminary results on generating walking and turning motion of a humanoid robot based on human motion data obtained by using motion capturing system. The target humanoid robot is recently released HRP-4C, which looks like a Japanese woman with realistic geometry. One of the main uses of this robot is to be entertainment. Therefore it is important that the robot\textquotesingle s motions are easily created, and feasible for the robot. Captured human motion data are used as a starting point, to which the following modifications are added: step length, speed, rotational angle during turn, and so on. Dynamic balance is also considered. Verification is conducted through both simulation and experiment with HRP-4C. A turning performance based on human motion is successfully demonstrated.}
