  abstract  = {This paper proposes a system to enable a humanoid robot to perform various tasks semi-autonomously according to higher-layer procedures called task sequences. A task sequence is a sequentially structured procedure that describes how to perform a particular task based on sensing data, motion planners, and a robot controller. These task sequences are processed by the task sequencer to move the robot. The goal of our system is to support comprehensive tasks, such as disaster response, with a number of task sequences defined for various subtasks. To efficiently develop required task sequences, the task sequencer is designed such that task sequences can be executed interactively; further, the task sequencer is integrated with a dynamics simulator that can be used to test the sequences without actually moving the robot. We verified our system by using it to make our HRP-2Kai robot perform the tasks defined in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, a competition involving disaster response robots.}
