  abstract  = {This paper presents the open architecture humanoid robotics platform (OpenHRP) which consists of a simulator and motion control library of humanoid robots. The binary software developed on OpenHRP can be applied to the real counterpart as is, thank to the proposed hardware abstraction and synchronization mechanism. The compatibility between the simulation and corresponding experiment has been successfully examined. OpenHRP is expected to initiate the exploration of humanoid robotics on open architecture software and hardware.},
