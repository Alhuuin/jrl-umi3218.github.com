  abstract  = {We address the problem of humanoid falling with a decoupled strategy consisting of a pre-impact and a postimpact stage. In the pre-impact stage, geometrical reasoning allows the robot to choose appropriate impact points in the surrounding environment and to adopt a posture to reach them while avoiding impact-singularities and preparing for the postimpact. The surrounding environment can be unstructured and may contain cluttered obstacles. The post-impact stage uses a quadratic program controller that adapts on-line the joint proportional-derivative (PD) gains to make the robot compliant \textendash to absorb impact and post-impact dynamics, which lowers possible damage risks. This is done by a new approach incorporating the stiffness and damping gains directly as decision variables in the QP along with the usually-considered variables of joint accelerations and contact forces. Constraints of the QP prevent the motors from reaching their torque limits during the fall. Several experiments on the humanoid robot HRP-4 in a full-dynamics simulator are presented and discussed.}
