  abstract  = {A development of humanoid robot HRP-2 is presented in this paper. HRP-2 is a humanoid robotics platform, which we developed in phase two of HRP. HRP was a humanoid robotics project, which had run by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998FY to 2002FY for five years. The ability of the biped locomotion of HRP-2 is improved so that HRP-2 can cope with uneven surface, can walk at two third level of human speed, and can walk on a narrow path. The ability of whole body motion of HRP-2 is also improved so that HRP-2 can get up by a humanoid robot\textquotesingle s own self if HRP-2 tips over safely. In this paper, the appearance design, the mechanisms, the electrical systems, specifications, and features upgraded from its prototype are also introduced.}
