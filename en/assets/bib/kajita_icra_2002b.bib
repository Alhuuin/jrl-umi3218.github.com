  abstract  = {For real-time walking control of a biped robot, we analyze the dynamics of a three-dimensional inverted pendulum whose motions are constrained onto an arbitrarily defined plane. This analysis leads us a simple linear dynamics, the Three-Dimensional Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode (3D-LIPM). Geometric nature of trajectories under the 3D-LIPM is discussed, and an algorithm for walking pattern generation is presented. Experimental results of real-time walking control of a 12-DOF biped robot HRP-2L using an input device such as a game pad are also shown.}
