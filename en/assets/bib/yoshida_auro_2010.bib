  abstract  = {In this paper we address whole-body manipulation of bulky objects by a humanoid robot. We adopt a \textquotedblleft pivoting\textquotedblright  manipulation method that allows the humanoid to displace an object without lifting, but by the support of the ground contact. First, the small-time controllability of pivoting is demonstrated. On its basis, an algorithm for collision-free pivoting motion planning is established taking into account the naturalness of motion as nonholonomic constraints. Finally, we present a whole-body motion generation method by a humanoid robot, which is verified by experiments.},
