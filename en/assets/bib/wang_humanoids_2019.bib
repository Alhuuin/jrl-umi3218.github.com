  abstract  = {Impact-aware tasks (i.e. on purpose impacts) are not handled in multi-objective whole body controllers of humanoid robots. This leads to the fact that a humanoid robot typically operates at near-zero velocity to interact with the external environment. We explicitly investigate the propagation of the impact-induced velocity and torque jumps along the structure linkage and propose a set of constraints that always satisfy the hardware limits, sustain already established contacts and the stability measure, i.e. the zero moment point condition. Without assumptions on the impact location or timing, our proposed controller enables humanoid robots to generate nonzero contact velocity without breaking the established contacts or falling. The novelty of our approach lies in building on existing continuous dynamics whole body multi-objective controller without the need of reset-maps or hybrid control.}
