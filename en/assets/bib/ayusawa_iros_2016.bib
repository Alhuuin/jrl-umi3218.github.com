  abstract  = {Human assistive devices are expected to support daily life in several nations, and are studied and developed intensively. In order to promote the industrial expansion in this field, the quantitative evaluation about their effect on humans will have a great role. We are investigating the new application of a humanoid robot as an evaluator of human assistive devices. In this framework, we could quantify the supportive effect of the assistive device by the robot’s sensors. In this framework, we also utilize a human motion retargeting technique for a humanoid robot. This talk shows our evaluation framework as well as the motion retargeting techniques with introducing some evaluation examples.}
