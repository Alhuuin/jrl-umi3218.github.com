  abstract  = {This paper presents a framework of simulation\textendash  based design for robotic care devices developed to reduce the burden of caregiver and care receivers. First, physical interaction between the user and device is quantitatively estimated by using a digital human simulator. Then we introduce a method for optimizing the design parameters according to given evaluation criteria. An example of trajectory optimization of transfer support robot is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method}
