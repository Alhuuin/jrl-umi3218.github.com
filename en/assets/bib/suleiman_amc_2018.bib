  abstract  = {In this paper we propose a new robust and computationally efficient algorithm to solve the problem of prioritized inverse kinematics (IK) tasks. The main idea of the new algorithm is assuming that the sampling time is a free variable and solving the IK problem with respect to an extended variable that includes the joint variation and the sampling time. The main advantage of the new formulation is that it can always provide a physically consistent solution, moreover the user only needs to provide a geometric description of the desired operational space paths as the algorithm provides the required time on the fly to convert those paths into trajectories for the robot joints. The proposed algorithm has been extensively validated in simulation, and the results revealed its efficiency to deal with the priority of tasks as well as the robot physical limits, furthermore, the algorithm always succeeded in providing an admissible solution.}
