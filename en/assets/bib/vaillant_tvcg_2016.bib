  abstract  = {We extend the quadratic program (QP)-based task-space character control approach\textemdash initially intended for individual
character animation\textemdash to multiple characters interacting among each other or with mobile/articulated elements of the environment.
The interactions between the characters can be either physical interactions, such as contacts that can be established or broken at will
between them and for which the forces are subjected to Newton’s third law, or behavioral interactions, such as collision avoidance and
cooperation that naturally emerge to achieve collaborative tasks from high-level specifications. We take a systematic approach
integrating all the equations of motions of the characters, objects, and articulated environment parts in a single QP formulation in order
to embrace and solve the most general instance of the problem, where independent individual character controllers would fail to
account for the inherent coupling of their respective motions through those physical and behavioral interactions. Various types of
motions/behaviors are controlled with only the one single formulation that we propose, and some examples of the original motions the
framework allows are presented in the accompanying video.},
