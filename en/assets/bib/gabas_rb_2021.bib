  abstract  = {Compared with more rigid objects, clothing items are inherently difficult for robots to recognize and manipulate. We propose a method for detecting how cloth is folded, to facilitate choosing a manipulative action that corresponds to a garment\textquotesingle s shape and position. The proposed method involves classifying the edges and corners of a garment by distinguishing between edges formed by folds and the hem or ragged edge of the cloth. Identifying the type of edges in a corner helps to determinate how the object is folded. This bottom-up approach, together with an active perception system, allows us to select strategies for robotic manipulation. We corroborate the method using a two-armed robot to manipulate towels of different shapes, textures, and sizes.},
