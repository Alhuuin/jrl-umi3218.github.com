  abstract  = {This paper presents a new adaptive attitude tracking controller for rigid body systems, with unknown inertia and unknown gyro-bias, using inertial vector measurements. The proposed control scheme guarantees almost global asymptotic convergence of the attitude and angular velocity to their desired values. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
