  abstract  = {We are developing remote control technologies for humanoid robots. The advantage of the remote control is that tele-operated humanoid robots can deal with various tasks according to the situation in real environment. Our goal is to develop the control system to execute the tele-operation of the humanoid robot easily. We developed whole body operation methods of the humanoid robot that works in environment with some obstacles. In this paper, we describe the developed method and experimental results using the tele-operation system of the humanoid robot HRP-3P. We discuss about the robot autonomy to perform the operation without difficulty}
