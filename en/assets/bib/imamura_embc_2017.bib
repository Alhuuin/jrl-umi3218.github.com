  abstract  = {This research proposes a novel method that evaluates joint reaction forces by motion analysis using a musculoskeletal model. While general muscle tension estimations minimize the sum of the muscle tensions, the proposed method utilizes the joint reaction forces themselves in the objective function of the optimization problem in addition to conventional method. This method can estimate a pattern of the muscle tensions that maximizes or minimizes a specific joint force. As a typical outcome, the proposed method allows evaluating intervertebral disc compressive force caused by co-contraction of muscles while avoiding risk underestimation. We analyzed the actual lifting motion as an example and confirmed that the method can estimate the muscle tension distribution under different tension conditions.}
