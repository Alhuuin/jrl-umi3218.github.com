  abstract  = {This paper describes an algorithm that enables a humanoid robot to perform an impulsive pedipulation task on a spherical object in the environment; that is, by using its feet to exert an impulsive force capable of driving the object to a 3D goal position while achieving certain motion characteristics. This is done by planning a suitable motion for the legs of the humanoid, capable to exert the required impact conditions on the spherical object while maintaining the dynamic stability of the robot. As an example of this algorithm implementation we consider the free kick in soccer and take it as a case study. Finally, we provide some simulation and experimental results that intend to show the validity of this algorithm.},
