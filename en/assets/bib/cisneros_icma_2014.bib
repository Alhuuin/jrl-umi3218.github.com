  abstract  = {This paper describes a generalized approach for compensating the net yaw moment of a humanoid robot about the Zero Moment Point while performing an arbitrary motion. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to prevent unwanted / unexpected yaw rotations by compensating the net yaw moment about the Zero Moment Point using \textquotedblleft free\textquotedblright  joints that are unrelated to the required task motion. For example, for a walking motion the joints of the chest, neck and arms may not have an assigned task, and can be used in combination to provide such compensation. Finally, some simulation results are provided, which intend to show the validity of this approach.}
