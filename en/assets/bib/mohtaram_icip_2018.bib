  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a descriptor for image matching under multiple mirror reflections. Indeed, existing adaptations of SIFT for the mirror transformation are not successful when object and mirrors orientations are not constrained. Hence, we propose to combine MIFT and Affine-SIFT descriptors as the Affine Mirror Invariant Feature Transform (AMIFT). The experimental results and given evaluation show that our proposed descriptor outperforms MIFT and ASIFT on both synthetic and real images datasets.}
