  abstract  = {This paper addresses the recognition of daily-life objects by a robot equipped with tactile sensors. The main contribution is a deep learning framework that can recognize objects already touched as well as objects never touched before. To this end, we train a deconvolutional neural network that generates synthetic tactile data for novel classes. Then, we use both these synthetic data and the real data collected by touching objects, to train a convolutional neural network to recognize both known (trained) objects and novel objects. Furthermore, we propose a method for integrating newly encountered data into novel classes. Finally, we evaluate the framework using the largest available dataset of tactile objects descriptions.},
