  abstract  = {In this paper we explore the underlying principles of natural locomotion path generation of human beings. The knowledge of these principles is useful to implement biologically inspired path planning algorithms on a humanoid robot. By ‘locomotion path’ we denote the motion of the robot as a whole in the plane. The key to our approach is to formulate the path planning problem as an optimal control problem. We propose a single dynamic model valid for all situations, which includes both non-holonomic and holonomic modes of locomotion, as well as an appropriately designed unified objective function. The choice between holonomic and non-holonomic behavior is not accomplished by a switching model, but it appears in a smooth way, along with the optimal path, as a result of the optimization by efficient numerical techniques. The proposed model and objective function are successfully tested in six different locomotion scenarios. The resulting paths are implemented on the HRP-2 robot in the simulation environment OpenHRP as well as in the experiment on the real robot.},
