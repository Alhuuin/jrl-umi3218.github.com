  abstract  = {We propose a solution which combines haptic sensing with safe interaction, at low cost. Contact locations are made through a flexible sheet of tactile binary switch matrix. This sheet covers the surface of a rigid bumper module assembled to the robot\textquotesingle s basic link through a distributed pressure sensing units. Combination of location and force provides the haptic sensing module. The haptic system is covered with a flexible outer material which role is to absorb contact impacts and to cast local surface profile on which the robot can take support. This overall system allows having a combined haptic sensing with safe and robust physical interaction with both the environment and the human using active compliance. We discuss the benefit of such a simple and modular concept and present how to design the cover material. A simple prototype is realized and experienced.}
