  abstract  = {In this paper, a first step is taken towards using vision in human-humanoid haptic joint actions. Haptic joint actions are characterized by physical interaction throughout the execution of a common goal. Because of this, most of the focus is on the use of force/torque-based control. However, force/torque information is not rich enough for some tasks. Here, a particular case is shown: height stabilization during table carrying. To achieve this, a visual servoing controller is used to generate a reference trajectory for the impedance controller. The control law design is fully described along with important considerations for the vision algorithm and a framework to make pose estimation robust during the table carrying task of the humanoid robot. We then demonstrate all this by an experiment where a human and the HRP-2 humanoid jointly transport a beam using combined force and vision data to adjust the interaction impedance while at the same time keeping the inclination of the beam horizontal.}
