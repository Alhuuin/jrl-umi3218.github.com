  abstract  = {Presents a miniaturized self-reconfigurable modular robotics system using shape memory alloy (SMA). The system is designed so that various shapes can be actively formed by a group of identical mechanical units. The unit realizes rotational motion by using an actuator mechanism composed of two SMA torsion coil springs which generate sufficient motion range and torque for reconfiguration. The fundamental functions of the system are tested by experiments. Applicability of the developed unit model to a 3-D self-reconfigurable system is also discussed}
