  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a real-time method for identification of the inertial parameters of a humanoid robot and an estimation of its center-of-mass (CoM) and linear and angular momentum. CoM and momentum are important for whole-body motion generation of a humanoid robot and can be used as an indicator of motion planning. Because they are affected by modeling errors and inertia changes (e.g., due to object grasping), it is important to estimate them online. The proposed method has the advantage of being based only on the internal sensors. We verified the effectiveness of the proposal method by applying it to a humanoid robot.}
