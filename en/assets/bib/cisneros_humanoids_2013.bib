  abstract  = {The aim of this paper is to develop an algorithm that enables a humanoid robot to perform an impulsive pedipulation of a spherical object by using its foot, so that the object reaches a desired 3D goal position, taking into account some constraints imposed at the moment of the impact. This is done by planning a suitable motion of the humanoid robot that exerts the required impact conditions on this object. Then, we take the free kick in soccer as a case of study that represents one possible application of this algorithm. Finally, we provide a simulation example that intends to show its validity.}
