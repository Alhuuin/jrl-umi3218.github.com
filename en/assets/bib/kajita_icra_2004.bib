  abstract  = {Aiming for a humanoid robot of the next generation, we have been developing a biped which can jump and run. This paper introduces biped robot HRP-2LR and its hopping with both legs as our first attempt towards running. Using a dynamic model of HRP-2LR, hopping patterns are pre-calculated so that it follows the desired profiles of the total linear and angular momentum. For this purpose we used resolved momentum control. Adding small modifications to negotiate the difference between the model and the real hardware, we successfully realized a steady hopping motion of 0.06 [s] flight phase and 0.5 [s] support phase. A hopping with forward velocity of 15 [mm/s] was also realized. Finally, a running pattern of 0.06 [s] flight and 03 [s] support phase was tested. HRP-2LR could successfully run with average speed of 0.16 [m/s].}
