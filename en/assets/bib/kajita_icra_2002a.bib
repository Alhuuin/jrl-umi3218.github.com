  abstract  = {A method of running pattern generation for a humanoid robot using the dynamics of a simple inverted pendulum is proposed. The dynamic simulation using a model of an actual humanoid robot shows that the robot can run by applying a generated pattern with slight modifications. The simulation is used to evaluate the required performance of the actuators for an actual running robot.}
