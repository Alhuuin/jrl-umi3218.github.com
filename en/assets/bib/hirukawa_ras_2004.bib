  abstract  = {This paper presents humanoid robotics platform that consists of a humanoid robot and an open architecture software platform developed in METI’s Humanoid Robotics Project (HRP). The final version of the robot, called HRP-2, has 1540\hspace{0.167em}mm height, 58\hspace{0.167em}kg weight and 30 degrees of the freedom. The software platform includes a dynamics simulator and motion controllers of the robot for biped locomotion, falling and getting up motions. The platform has been used to develop various applications and is expected to initiate more humanoid robotics research.},
