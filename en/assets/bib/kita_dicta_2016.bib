  abstract  = {Many studies have developed methods of making three-dimensional measurements from fisheye images. Most of these methods assume a single-viewpoint model. However, the viewpoint of a fisheye lens shifts along the optical axis according to the incident angle between the optical axis and the incident light ray. The author previously analyzed the error resulting from using the single-viewpoint model for three-dimensional measurements from fisheye images and clarified that the error is not negligible under some conditions. In particular, the errors in stereo measurements were remarkable. This implies that some knowledge about the viewpoint shift can be obtained from the stereo matching coordinates on stereo images. The present paper obtains an interesting relation of the shift magnitude at a couple of incident angles from a pair of coordinates. Moreover, the relations of shift magnitudes are integrated to obtain an important hint for the calibration of the viewpoint-shifting model.}
