  abstract  = {In this letter, we propose an efficient and highly versatile loco-manipulation planning for humanoid robots. Loco-manipulation planning is a key technological brick enabling humanoid robots to autonomously perform object transportation by manipulating them. We formulate planning of the alternation and sequencing of footsteps and grasps as a graph search problem with a new transition model that allows for a flexible representation of loco-manipulation. Our transition model is quickly evaluated by relocating and switching the reachability maps depending on the motion of both the robot and object. We evaluate our approach by applying it to loco-manipulation use-cases, such as a bobbin rolling operation with regrasping, where the motion is automatically planned by our framework.},
