  abstract  = {This article reviews the state-of-the-art of nonlinear solvers as well as frameworks for numerical optimization, which is more and more utilized
for robotics applications. We will discuss the features and project status for each solver and detail how one can use a numerical optimization framework to avoid being limited to a particular solver. 
The comparison allows to choose the appropriate strategy in robotics where trajectory generation, posture generation, control can be implemented as different types of optimization problems.},
