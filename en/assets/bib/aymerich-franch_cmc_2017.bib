  abstract  = {Humanoid robot embodiment is a recently developed form of mediated embodiment. In 2 studies, we report and quantify a new haptic (touch) illusion during embodiment of a humanoid robot. Around 60\% of the users in our studies reported haptic sensations in their real hand when they observed their robot avatar touching a curtain with its hand. Critically, our study shows for the first time that users can experience haptic sensations from a nonanthropomorphic embodied limb/agent with visual feedback alone (i.e. no haptic feedback provided). The results have important implications for the understanding of the cognitive processes governing mediated embodiment and the design of avatar scenarios.},
