  abstract  = {This paper deals with whole-body motion planning and dynamic control for humanoid from two aspects: locomotion including manipulation and reaching. In the first part, we address a problem of simultaneous locomotion and manipulation planning that combines a geometric and kinematic motion planner with a dynamic humanoid motion generator. The second part deals with whole-body reaching tasks by using a generalized inverse kinematics (IK) method to fully exploit the high redundancy of the humanoid robot. Through experiments using humanoid platform HRP-2 No. 14 installed at LAAS-CNRS, we first verify the validity of each method. An integrated experiment is then presented that unifies the both results via visual perception to execute an object-fetching task.},
