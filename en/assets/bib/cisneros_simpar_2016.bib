  abstract  = {This paper presents a technique to achieve a stable simulation of flexible cable-like objects approximated as serial kinematic chains with a high number of passive degrees of freedom. This is achieved by implementing a dry-friction model based on implicit Euler integration of Coulomb-like discontinuous friction, which does not exhibit chattering nor unbounded drift. The applicability of this technique is demonstrated through its implementation to simulate a hose for the Japan Virtual Robotics Challenge.}
