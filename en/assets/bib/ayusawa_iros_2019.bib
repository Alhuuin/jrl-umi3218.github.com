  abstract  = {This paper presents an inverse kinematics (IK) method which can control future velocities and accelerations for multi-body systems. The proposed IK method is formulated as a quadratic programing (QP) that optimizes future joint trajectories. The features of the proposed IK are: (1) the evaluation of accelerations at future time instances, (2) the trajectory representation that can implicitly integrate the time integralformulaintoQP,(3)thecomputationoffutureJacobian matrices based on the comprehensive theory of differential kinematics proposed in our previous work. Those features enable a stable and fast IK computation while evaluating the future accelerations. We also conducted thorough numerical studies to show the efficiency of the proposed method.}
