  abstract  = {This paper proposes the kinodynamic gait planning for humanoid robots where both kinematics and dynamics of the system are considered. We can simultaneously plan both the foot-place and the whole-body motion taking the dynamical balance of the robot into consideration. As a dynamic constraint, we consider the differential equation of the robotpsilas CoG. To solve this constraint, we assume two walking pattern generators; the offline and the online ones. We randomly sample the configuration space to search for the path connecting the start and the goal configurations. When sampling the configuration space, three milestones are sequentially connected to the parent milestone. To show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we show simulation and experimental results where the humanoid robot HRP-2 walks on several environments.}
