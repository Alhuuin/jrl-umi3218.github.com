  abstract  = {A self-assembling and self-repairing mechanical system is experimentally studied to demonstrate its effectiveness. We developed a 2-D model of autonomous me- chanical unit capable of dynamic reconfiguration and inter-unit communication. Self-assembly and self-repair experiments have been carried out using a distributed algorithm developed under the constraints of the system\textquotesingle s homogeneity and locality of information exchange. In experiments, more than ten units successfully config- ured themselves and recovered from a fault. Besides the research of the 2-D model, a model of 3-D system and its self-assembly algorithm are also developed.},
