  abstract  = {Robotic care devices are the assistive device that supports human movement directly by physical interaction. In order to improve such devices, the quantitative evaluation about their effect on human will be indispensable. We aim to develop the method supporting the human-centered design and promote industry by making industrial standards about effect on humans. As a first step, this paper presents our work about the design support for robotic transfer aid by using digital human models and its dynamics analysis.}
