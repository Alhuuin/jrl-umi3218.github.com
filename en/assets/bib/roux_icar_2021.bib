  abstract  = {Enforcing balance of multi-limbed robots in multiple non-coplanar unilateral contact settings is challenging when a subset of such contacts are also induced in motion tasks. The first contribution of this paper is in enhancing the computational performance of state-of-the-art geometric center-of-mass inclusion-based balance method to be integrated online as part of a task-space whole-body control framework. As a consequence, our second contribution lies in integrating such a balance region with relevant contact force distribution without pre-computing a target center-of-mass. This last feature is essential to leave the latter with freedom to better comply with other existing tasks that are not captured in classical two-level approaches. We assess the performance of our proposed method through experiments using the HRP-4 humanoid robot.}
