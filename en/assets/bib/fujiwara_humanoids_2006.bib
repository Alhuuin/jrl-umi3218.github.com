  abstract  = {This paper studies an optimal planning of falling motions of a human-sized humanoid robot to reduce the damage of the robot. We developed a human-sized robot HRP-2FX which has a simplified humanoid robot shape with seven d.o.f. and can emulate motions in the sagittal plane of a humanoid robot. We simulated falling motions of HRP-2FX which generated by using an optimal control method to minimize a performance index, and verified the optimality}
