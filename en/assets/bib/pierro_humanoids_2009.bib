  abstract  = {In this paper we present a different strategy for generating the trajectory of the swinging leg for a walking humanoid robot which takes into account the effects due to acceleration and velocities of the joints onto the center of mass of the robot. The trajectory of the leg is chosen to be constituted by two forth order polynomials interlaced by a via-point which satisfies the optimality criterium. This approach is validated on a humanoid robot HRP-2.}
