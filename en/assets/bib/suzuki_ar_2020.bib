  abstract  = {Electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) has backdrivability and is suitable for a robot system that cooper-ates with human. However, its design methodology to miniaturize and to generate high pressure hasnot been established. We develop a robotic arm, all joints of which are actuated by EHAs. This paperreports the development of the vane motor type EHA and a wrist mechanism using the EHA. Weemploy a single vane motor for a wide motion range. In order to suppress internal leakage, we care-fully set the clearance of the EHA and made the rigid casing by using ceramics disks. It is confirmedthat the internal leakage of the new EHA is significantly reduced compared to that of the previousmodel. The wrist mechanism has three degrees of freedom, consisting of three vane motors in series.The flow path between a hydraulic pump and a vane motor is designed using metal pipings, swiveljoints and manifolds are presented for a compact wrist mechanism. We validated the fundamentalperformance of the developed wrist mechanism through experiments},
