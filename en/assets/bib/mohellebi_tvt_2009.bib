  abstract  = {Controlling a virtual vehicle is a sensory-motor activity with a specific rendering methodology that depends on the hardware technology and the software in use. We propose a method that computes haptic feedback for the steering wheel. It is best suited for low-cost, fixed-base driving simulators but can be ported to any driving simulator platform. The goal of our method is twofold. 1) It provides an efficient yet simple algorithm to model the steering mechanism using a quadri-polar representation. 2) This model is used to compute the haptic feedback on top of which a tunable haptic augmentation is adjusted to overcome the lack of presence and the unavoidable simulation loop latencies. This algorithm helps the driver to laterally control the virtual vehicle. We also discuss the experimental results that demonstrate the usefulness of our haptic feedback method.},
