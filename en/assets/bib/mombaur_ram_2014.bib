  abstract  = {The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) Technical Committee (TC) on Model-Based Optimization for Robotics was founded and approved by the IEEE to promote the use of optimization methods in robotics RAS Technical Activities Board and the RAS Administrative Committee in October 2012. Important research areas in the scope of this TC include, the optimization-based generation of robot trajectories using dynamical models of the robot and its environment, online motion control using realtime model-based optimization and model predictive control/receding horizon control, and many others. Several activities aim to bridge the gap between the mathematical optimization and the robotics communities via activities at major mathematical optimization and scientific computing conferences.},
