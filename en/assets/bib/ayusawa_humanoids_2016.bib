  abstract  = {This presentation deals with the inertial parameters identification for humanoid robots and humans. The identification of inertial parameters of a robot system has been developed since the mid-1980s. Those classical methodologies are, however, focusing on the robot system whose base is fixed to the environment. This talk introduces our methodology which can handle the system with floating base such as humanoid systems. We at first show some important mechanical feature to analyze the floating base systems with many degree of freedoms. Based on the features, the methods to identify the inertial parameters of humanoid systems are presented, with reporting our applications of identification for both humanoid robots and humans. We also show the recent methodology and results based on optimization techniques in order to handle several issues related to the physical consistency and identifiability problem.}
