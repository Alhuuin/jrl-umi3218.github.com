  abstract  = {We propose a method to plan optimal whole-body dynamic motion in multi-contact non-gaited transitions. Using a B-spline time parameterization for the active joints, we turn the motion-planning problem into a semi-infinite programming formulation that is solved by nonlinear optimization techniques. Our main contribution lies in producing constraint-satisfaction guaranteed motions for any time grid. Indeed, we use Taylor series expansion to approximate the dynamic and kinematic models over fixed successive time intervals, and transform the problem (constraints and cost functions) into time polynomials which coefficients are function of the optimization variables. The evaluation of the constraints turns then into computation of extrema (over each time interval) that are given to the solver. We also account for collisions and self-collisions constraints that have not a closed-form expression over the time. We address the problem of the balance within the optimization problem and demonstrate that generating whole-body multi-contact dynamic motion for complex tasks is possible and can be tractable, although still time consuming. We discuss thoroughly the planning of a sitting motion with the HRP-2 humanoid robot and assess our method with several other complex scenarios.},
