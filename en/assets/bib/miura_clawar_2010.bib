  abstract  = {This paper presents an analysis on generating turning motion of a humanoid robot by slipping the feet on the ground. Humans unconsciously exploit the fact that our feet slip on the ground and realize smooth turn without stepping many times. In order to generate the slip motion, we need to predict the amount of slip. We propose the hypothesis that the turning motion is caused by the effect of minimizing the power generated by floor friction. A model of rotation is described on the basis of our hypothesis. The case that a robot applies the same force on both feet is discussed. The feet trajectory to maximize the rotational angle is also investigated based on the proposed hypothesis. The arc trajectories of both feet are adopted to generate turning motion in order to realize intended rotational angle. The hypothesis is verified through experiments with a humanoid robot HRP-4C.}
