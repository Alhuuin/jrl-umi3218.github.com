  abstract  = {In this paper we present a methodology for estimating joints torque due to external forces applied to a robot with large joints backlash. This undesired non-linearity is common in personal robot, due to the use of low cost mechanical components. This method enables collision detection and physical interaction capabilities without using extra sensors. The effectiveness of the new method is shown with experiments on a Romeo robot arm from SoftBank robotics.}
