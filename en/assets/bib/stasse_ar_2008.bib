  abstract  = {In this paper we describe the use of design patterns as a basis for creating a Humanoid Walking Pattern Generator Software having a modular architecture. This architecture made possible the
rapid porting of several novel walking algorithms on a full size humanoid robot HRP-2. The body of work currently available allows extracting a general software architecture usable with inter-exchange
between simulations and real experiments. The proposed architecture with the associated design patterns are described together with several applications: a pattern generator for a HRP-2 with
passive toe-joints, a pattern for dynamically stepping over large obstacles, and a new quadratic problem (QP) formulation for the generation of the reference ZMP. Thanks to the versatility and
the modularity of the proposed framework, the QP method has been implemented and experienced within four days only.},
