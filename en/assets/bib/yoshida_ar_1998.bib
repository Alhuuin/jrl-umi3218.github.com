  abstract  = {A novel design method of robot behavior is discussed to realize efficient local communication for cooperation of multiple mobile robots. Local communication is now increasingly utilized in cooperative many-robot systems because of its advantages of load distribution and simple implementation. In its usage, the design of each robot\textquotesingle s behavior is a very important issue since it has a significant effect upon the communication efficiency in a collective manner. In this study, we introduce a simple group behavior and analyze how it improves the performance of local communication among many mobile robots. The performance is evaluated using the information transmission time that plays a crucial part in effective cooperation. Next, the optimal group size is analytically derived by minimizing the transmission time. The effectiveness of the analytical design method is verified by computer simulations of many-robot communication.},
