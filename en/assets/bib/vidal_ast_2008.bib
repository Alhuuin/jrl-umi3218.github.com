  abstract  = {Interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) have been developed for many years leading to materials with controlled properties. When an electronic conducting polymer (ECP) is incorporated into an IPN, this one becomes a conducting IPN (CIPN). The synthetic pathway ensures a non homogeneous dispersion of the ECP through the IPN thickness of the material. The system is thus similar to a layered one with the advantage that the intimate combination of the three polymers needs no adhesive interface. The last step in making the CIPN into an actuator is to ensure the ionic conductivity by incorporation of an ionic salt. The highest ionic conductivity through the IPN matrix is necessary in order to ensure the best actuation. The chosen salt is an ionic liquid, i.e. 1-ethyl-3- methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMImTFSI). Based on IPN architectures electrochemical actuators have been designed and actuation in open air has been characterized.},
