  abstract  = {This paper shows some preliminary results on the dynamical balance of a humanoid robot grasping an environment. By grasping an environment, it becomes easier for the robot to keep balance. By using the linear programming, a necessary condition for keeping balance of the robot is formulated taking the grasping force into consideration. We show that the occasion exists where the stronger the hand of a humanoid robot grasps the handrail, the larger the region of ZMP for keeping balance becomes. We further show an experimental result of a humanoid robot climbing up a big gap increasing the stability by grasping a handrail.}
