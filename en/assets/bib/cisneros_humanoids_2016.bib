  abstract  = {This paper describes the methodology followed to enable a semi-autonomous humanoid robot to pass through a narrow lane filled with debris, a task that was originally inspired by the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials. During this competition, each team had 30 minutes to complete the task, a time limit that was not suitable if 8 tasks had to be completed within one hour, as in the Finals. It was then our objective to speed up the performance of this task, and try to complete it as fast as we could. The resulting strategy is described here, as well as an analysis of the outcome and a comparison of performance with the teams that participated in the Trials.}
