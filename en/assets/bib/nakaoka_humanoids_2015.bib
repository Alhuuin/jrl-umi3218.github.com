  abstract  = {This study describes our teleoperation interface, through which an operator can dictate various tasks to a biped humanoid robot. In this interface, the robot model and the environmental data are presented in three-dimensional computer graphics, and the robot actions are specified by several operational markers. The interface also provides a task sequencer function, enabling the operator to perform a task merely by proceeding a task sequence, which structures the procedure of a particular task. The task sequencer provides a much more efficient operation than the direct use of operational markers. We verified the interface by participation in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Finals. Our humanoid robot HRP-2kai operated through our teleoperation interface completed most of the DRC tasks.}
