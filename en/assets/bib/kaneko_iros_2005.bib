  abstract  = {This paper presents a slip observer towards stabilizing biped walks on a low friction floor. Although biped humanoid robots are expected to easily adapt to environments designed for human, in fact they tend to tip over easily on real environments. For a practical use, it is one of important issues to stabilize a biped walking on an unexpected slippery floor with a low friction. In this paper, we propose the slip observer detecting skids that would occur at walking on unexpected slippery floor. We also propose a basic study of slip stabilizer towards reducing posture rolling caused by skids. Finally, we present experimental results using a humanoid robot HRP-2 to verify the validity of the proposed control scheme.}
