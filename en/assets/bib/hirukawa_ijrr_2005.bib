  abstract  = {In this paper we present a humanoid robot, HRP-2P, which can walk, lie down and get up. We believe that HRP-2P (154 cm height and 58 kg weight) is the first humanoid robot that is the size of a human and can lie down and get up. Biped walking is realized by a walking pattern generator using a preview control and a feedback control. The lying down and getting up motions were made possible by HRP-2Pâ€™s compact body with a waist joint and a novel motion controller.},
