  abstract  = {Direct Visual Servoing (DVS) considers pixel brightness directly as input of robot control. Recent DVS variants consider image processing as smoothing or frequency domain transforms, resulting in large convergence domains. This paper proposes to consider defocus to optically smooth images without processing. The resulting Defocus-based DVS shows convergence domains competing with the state-of-the-art, larger in some challenging cases, for lower complexity.},
