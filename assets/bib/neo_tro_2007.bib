  abstract  = {This paper introduces a framework for whole-body motion generation integrating operator\textquotesingle s control and robot\textquotesingle s autonomous functions during online control of humanoid robots. Humanoid robots are biped machines that usually possess multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). The complexity of their structure and the difficulty in maintaining postural stability make the whole-body control of humanoid robots fundamentally different from fixed-base manipulators. Getting hints from human conscious and subconscious motion generations, the authors propose a method of generating whole-body motions that integrates the operator\textquotesingle s command input and the robot\textquotesingle s autonomous functions. Instead of giving commands to all the joints all the time, the operator selects only the necessary points of the humanoid robot\textquotesingle s body for manipulation. This paper first explains the concept of the system and the framework for integrating operator\textquotesingle s command and autonomous functions in whole-body motion generation. Using the framework, autonomous functions were constructed for maintaining postural stability constraint while satisfying the desired trajectory of operation points, including the feet, while interacting with the environment. Finally, this paper reports on the implementation of the proposed method to teleoperate two 30-DOF humanoid robots, HRP-1S and HRP-2, by using only two 3-DOF joysticks. Experiments teleoperating the two robots are reported to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
