  abstract  = {We propose a new methodology for decoding movement intentions of humans. This methodology is motivated by the well-documented ability of the brain to predict sensory outcomes of self-generated and imagined actions using so-called forward models. We propose to subliminally stimulate the sensory modality corresponding to a user’s intended movement, and decode a user’s movement intention from his electroencephalography (EEG), by decoding for prediction errors\textemdash whether the sensory prediction corresponding to a user’s intended movement matches the subliminal sensory stimulation we induce. We tested our proposal in a binary wheelchair turning task in which users thought of turning their wheelchair either left or right. We stimulated their vestibular system subliminally, toward either the left or the right direction, using a galvanic vestibular stimulator and show that the decoding for prediction errors from the EEG can radically improve movement intention decoding performance. We observed an 87.2\% median single-trial decoding accuracy across tested participants, with zero user training, within 96 ms of the stimulation, and with no additional cognitive load on the users because the stimulation was subliminal.},
