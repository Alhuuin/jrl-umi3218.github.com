  abstract  = {Meltran V, a new biped robot with telescopic legs, is introduced. For 3D walking control of the robot we analyze the dynamics of a three-dimensional inverted pendulum in which motion is constrained to move along an arbitrarily defined plane. From this analysis we obtain simple linear dynamics, the three-dimensional linear inverted pendulum mode (3D-LIPM). Using a real-time control method based on 3D-LIPM, the Meltran V robot successfully demonstrated 3D dynamic walking without the use of any prepared trajectories.}
