  abstract  = {In this paper we realize a real-time communication on Ethernet and develop an onbody distributed control system for a humanoid robot, HRP-3P. Real-time communication on Ethernet is realized by (1) a communication method using the data link layer directly and (2) timing control using a real-time operating system ARTLinux. This enables us to reduce the cost of embedded systems and improve developmental efficiency. A CORBA implementation which works on this communication layer is also developed to increase compatibility with existing software. Finally a small-size distributed robot controller is developed for the onbody network of HRP-3P and a distributed I/O system is developed on top of this}
