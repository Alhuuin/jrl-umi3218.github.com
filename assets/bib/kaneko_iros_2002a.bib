  abstract  = {This paper discusses the determination of torque commands for always guaranteeing the body propelling motion in Hugging Walk where the environment is enveloped by legs and the body. There are two key issues, one is to obtain the sub-total force set with the function of the joint torque in each leg, and the other is to obtain the constraint space where the body propelling motion is guaranteed without the body rotating motion when the sub-total force set is put in it. The basic idea is demonstrated by simulation and experiment.}
