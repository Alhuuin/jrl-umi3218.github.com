  abstract  = {Estimation of muscle activity is very important as it can be a cue to assess a person\&rsquo;s movements and intentions. If muscle activity states can be obtained through non-contact measurement, through visual measurement systems, for example, muscle activity will provide data support and help for various study fields. In the present paper, we propose a method to predict human muscle activity from skin surface strain. This requires us to obtain a 3D reconstruction model with a high relative accuracy. The problem is that reconstruction errors due to noise on raw data generated in a visual measurement system are inevitable. In particular, the independent noise between each frame on the time series makes it difficult to accurately track the motion. In order to obtain more precise information about the human skin surface, we propose a method that introduces a temporal constraint in the non-rigid registration process. We can achieve more accurate tracking of shape and motion by constraining the point cloud motion over the time series. Using surface strain as input, we build a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network for inferring muscle activity. In the present paper, we investigate simple lower limb movements to train the network. As a result, we successfully achieve the estimation of muscle activity via surface strain.},
