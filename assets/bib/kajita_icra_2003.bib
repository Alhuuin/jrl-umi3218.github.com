  abstract  = {We introduce a new method of a biped walking pattern generation by using a preview control of the zero-moment point (ZMP). First, the dynamics of a biped robot is modeled as a running cart on a table which gives a convenient representation to treat ZMP. After reviewing conventional methods of ZMP based pattern generation, we formalize the problem as the design of a ZMP tracking servo controller. It is shown that we can realize such controller by adopting the preview control theory that uses the future reference. It is also shown that a preview controller can be used to compensate the ZMP error caused by the difference between a simple model and the precise multibody model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a simulation of walking on spiral stairs.}
