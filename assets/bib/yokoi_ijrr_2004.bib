  abstract  = {We have developed a humanoid robot HRP-1S that is capable of simultaneous whole body motion control. In phase one of the Humanoid Robotics Project (HRP) of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan, Honda R\&D Co. Ltd has produced humanoid robot HRP-1 as a humanoid research platform to ease the development of good applications for humanoid robots in phase two of HRP. However, HRP-1 controls its legs and arms separately, and is not suitable for some applications. We modified the control hardware of HRP-1 and implemented our own control software. The modified robot was designated HRP-1S. The motion controller of HRP-1S is built in accordance with the plug-in architecture. We have developed some plug-ins including a real-time walking pattern generator (KWALK plug-in) and a reflex controller (STABILIZER plug-in) to maintain the dynamic balance of HRP-1S. In this paper, we present the system architecture of the control system of HRP-1S and several experimental results.},
