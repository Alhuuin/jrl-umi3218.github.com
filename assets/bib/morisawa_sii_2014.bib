  abstract  = {This paper presents a biped locomotion control method for an exploration in unknown environment. It is still hard for humanoid robot to walk autonomously even an artificial construction such as a power plant which are overly arranged many stairs and pipes. In such an environment, the physical constraints with a collision avoidance, joint limitations and support region on the terrain, become dominant limitations for an exploration. Updating environmental information to biped walking pattern generator and controller, a biped walking on a complicated rough terrain can be achieved. The proposed method is validated through several dynamics simulations with the HRP-2 humanoid robot.}
