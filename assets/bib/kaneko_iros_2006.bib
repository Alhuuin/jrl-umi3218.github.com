  abstract  = {This paper presents a motion suspension system to suspend humanoid motion in case of emergency. Once humanoids start their motions in human daily environments, there is a possibility that humanoids will meet with several emergencies such as hurting humans and injuring themselves. Even so, humanoids should be controlled so that they avert such emergencies in real-time. To realize this demand, we propose a method of real-time judgment of emergency prediction by humanoids. We also propose a simple and effective method of real-time pattern generation to force humanoids to stop immediately by one step without falling. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we finally present experimental results using a humanoid robot HRP-2, which include experiments at 2.8 [km/h] walks}
