  abstract  = {In order for robots to execute several tasks at the office or at home, they need enormous amounts of information. If we put a small amount of intelligence into each
item that is part of the ambience, the ambience itself can simply cause the robots to change their state as it requests. We call such an ambience \textquotedblleft Intelligent Ambience (IA).\textquotedblright  In this paper, a design of IA is described.
We have constructed an example of an IA and verified its effectiveness through experimentation.},
