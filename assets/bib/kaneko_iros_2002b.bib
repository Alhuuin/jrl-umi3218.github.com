  abstract  = {This paper presents a prototype humanoid robotics platform developed for HRP-2. HRP-2 is a new humanoid robotics platform, which we have been developing in phase two of HRP HRP is a humanoid robotics project, which has been launched by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998FY to 2002FY for five years. The ability of the biped locomotion of HRP-2 is improved so that HRP-2 can cope with rough terrain in the open air and can prevent the possible damages to a humanoid robot\textquotesingle s own self in the event of tipping over. The ability of whole body motion of HRP-2 is also improved so that HRP-2 can get up by a humanoid robot\textquotesingle s own self even tough HRP-2 tips over. In this paper, the mechanisms and specifications of developed prototype humanoid robotics platform, and its electrical system are introduced.}
