  abstract  = {We developed a key pose input system using a KinectTM sensor for Choreonoid, an integrated software that helps to generate humanoid robot motion easily. The system captures a real human pose and calculates the joint angles of a humanoid robot to generate its key pose. The proposed method is able to detect the support leg automatically and calculate a set of joint angles for the humanoid robot which satisfies the support condition.}
