  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel technique for ana-lyzing and designing local communication systems for distributed mobile robotic systems (DMRS). Our goal is to provide an analysis-base guideline for designing local communication sys-tems to efficiently transmit task information to the appropriate robots. In this paper, we propose a layered methodology, i.e., design from spatial and temporal aspects based on analysis of in-formation diffusion by local communication between robots. The task environment is classified so that each analysis and design is applied in a systematic way. The spatial design gives the optimal communication area for minimizing transmission time for various cooperative tasks. In the temporal design, we derive the infor-mation announcing time to avoid excessive information diffusion. The designed local communication is evaluated in comparison with global communication. Finally, we performed simulations and experiments to demonstrate that the analysis and design technique is effective for constructing an efficient local communi-cation system.},
