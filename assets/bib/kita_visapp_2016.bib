  abstract  = {When a humanoid robot walks through or performs a task in a very narrow space, it sometimes touches the environment with its hand or arm to retain its balance. To do this the robot must identify a flat surface of appropriate size with which it can make sufficient contact; the surface must also be within reach of robot\textquotesingle s upper body. Using fisheye stereo vision, it is possible to obtain image information for a field of view wider than that of a hemisphere whose central axis is the optical axes; thus, three dimensional distances to the possible contact spaces can be evaluated at a glance. To realize it, stereo correspondence is crucial. However, the short distance between the stereo cameras and the target space causes differences in the apparent shapes of the targets in the left and right images, which can make stereo correspondence difficult. Therefore, we propose a novel method which rectifies stereo images so that the targets have the same apparent shapes in the left and right images when the targets are close to a reference plane. Actual fisheye stereo image pairs were rectified, and three dimensional measurements were performed. Better results were obtained using the proposed rectification method than using other rectification methods}
