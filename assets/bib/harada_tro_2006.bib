  abstract  = {In this paper, we analyze the balance of a humanoid robot during manipulation tasks. By defining the generalized zero-moment point (GZMP), we obtain the region of it for keeping the balance of the robot during manipulation. During manipulation, the convex hull of the supporting points forms the 3-D convex polyhedron. The region of the GZMP is obtained by considering the infinitesimal displacement and the moment about the edges of the convex hull. We show that we can determine whether or not the robot may keep balance for several styles of manipulation tasks, such as pushing and pulling an object. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by simulation.},
