  abstract  = {This paper introduces an open architecture humanoid robotics platform (OpenHRP) on which various building blocks of humanoid robotics can be investigated. OpenHRP is a virtual humanoid robot platform with a compatible humanoid robot, and consists of a simulator of humanoid robots and motion control library for them which can also be applied to a compatible humanoid robot as it is. OpenHRP is expected to initiate the exploration of humanoid robotics on an open architecture software and hardware, due to the unification of the controllers and the examined consistency between the simulator and a real humanoid robot.}
