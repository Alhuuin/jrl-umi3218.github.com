  abstract  = {A good understanding of handovers between humans is critical for the development of robots in the service industry. Here investigated the extent to which humans estimate their partner"s behavior during handovers. We show that, even in the absence of visual feedback, humans modulate their handover location for partners they have just met, and according to their distance from the partner, such that the resulting handover errors are consistently small. Our results suggest that humans can predict each other"s preferred handover location.}
