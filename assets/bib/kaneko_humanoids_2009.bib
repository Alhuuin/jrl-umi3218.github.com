  abstract  = {The development of cybernetic human HRP-4C is presented in this paper. The word \textquestiondown cybernetic human\textquestiondown  is a coinage for us to explain a humanoid robot with a realistic head and a realistic figure of a human being. HRP-4C stands for humanoid robotics platform-4 (cybernetic human). Standing 158 [cm] tall and weighting 43 [kg] (including batteries), with the joints and dimensions set to average values for young Japanese females, HRP-4C looks very human-like. This paper introduces the design process, mechanical features, and electrical features with specifications of HRP-4C.}
