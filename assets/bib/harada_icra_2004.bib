  abstract  = {This work proposes a new style of manipulation by a humanoid robot. Focusing on the task of pushing an object, the foot placement of it is planed in real-time according to the result of manipulation of an object. By controlling the arms using the impedance control, a humanoid robot can push an object stably regardless of the mass of an object. If an object is heavy, a humanoid robot pushes an object with walking slowly, and vice versa. Also, for planning the gait in real-time, we newly propose an analytical method where the newly calculated trajectory of the robot motion is smoothly connected to the current one. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation and experiment.}
