  abstract  = {We present a forward dynamics (FD) simulation technique for human figures when they are supported by assistive devices. By incorporating a geometric skin deformation model, called linear blend skinning (skinning), into rigid-body skeleton dynamics, we can model a time-varying geometry of body surface plausibly and efficiently. Based on the skinning model, we also derive a Jacobian (a linear mapping) that maps contact forces exerted on the skin to joint torques, which is the main technical contribution of this paper. This algorithm allows us to efficiently simulate dynamics of human body that interacts with assistive devices. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach can generate plausible motions and can estimate pressure distribution that is roughly comparable to the tactile sensor data.}
