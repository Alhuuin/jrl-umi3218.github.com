  abstract  = {For 3D walking control of a biped robot we analyze the dynamics of a 3D inverted pendulum in which motion is constrained to move along an arbitrarily defined plane. This analysis yields a simple linear dynamics, the 3D linear inverted pendulum mode (3D-LIPM). Geometric nature of trajectories under the 3D-LIPM and a method for walking pattern generation are discussed. A simulation result of a walking control using a 12-DOF biped robot model is also shown.}
