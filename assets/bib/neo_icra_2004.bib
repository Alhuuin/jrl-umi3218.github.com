  abstract  = {The establishment of an intuitive and effective whole body operation method is essential for the utilization of humanoid robots in real world tasks. Here we introduce a method for humanoid robot foot teleoperation, as a part of our whole body teleoperation system using only a simple joystick device. This paper explains a framework for real-time foot operation which incorporates the operator\textquotesingle s foot command and robot\textquotesingle s autonomy in maintaining balance. We describe the algorithm of an autonomous function which shifts the position of the robot\textquotesingle s center of mass interactively based on the operator\textquotesingle s command and the current feet condition of the robot. We report on successful experimental results of teleoperating a real humanoid robot HRP-2 using the proposed method.}
