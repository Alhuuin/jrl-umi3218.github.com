  abstract  = {We propose algorithms to compute the 3D robust stability region in multi-contact. It is well known that the stability region is a product of convex cones and hence is a convex polyhedron. Our stability region extends existing recursive 2D static stability approaches to 3D by accounting for possible center of mass accelerations. We provide algorithms that construct the region of robust stability in a systematic way. We compare our lgorithms and discuss possible computation of intermediary shapes using morphing. Finally, we provide an example of usage in generating robust static postures that can serve the purpose of multi-contact planning.},
