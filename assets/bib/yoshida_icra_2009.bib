  abstract  = {A method of regrasp planning for humanoid robot manipulation is proposed. We adopt pivoting manipulation for the humanoid robot to move a bulky object without lifting in a stable and dexterous manner. In order to carry the object to a desired place, the humanoid should sometimes move through narrow areas surrounded by obstacles. We propose a roadmap multiplexing planning to allow the robot to leave the object near narrow places and to regrasp it from another position to continue carrying. We utilize visibility probabilistic roadmap (PRM) method as a preprocessing to capture the critical configurations for regrasping. Then a diffusion method is employed to plan the overall manipulation path including regrasping. The proposed method is verified through planning simulation including whole-body motions.}
