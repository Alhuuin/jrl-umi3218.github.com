  abstract  = {This work studies locomotion planning of humanoid robots to pass through narrow spaces. Humanoid robots can alter the style of the locomotion while wheeled robots can not. The proposed method generates a 3D local map from visual information and plans the appropriate locomotion based on the map from biped walking with the variable height and the width and from crawling.}
