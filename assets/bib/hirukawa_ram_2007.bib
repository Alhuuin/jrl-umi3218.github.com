  abstract  = {We developed biped dinosaur robots to make a breakthrough in the barrier that has prevented humanoid robots from being deployed. As the result, we showed that millions of people could be attracted to see robot bipeds walking. The robots were used for the communication of natural science (the history of dinosaurs) to the general public but also to demonstrate the power of modern robotics technology. The robots were really popular especially for the children and sometimes made them cry, since the robots looked quite realistic. We showed that the robots could be operated for a long period regardless of the risk of the damage. As we expected, the soft and thick skin could absorb the impact on the landing of the body, and the resulting damage was minor.},
