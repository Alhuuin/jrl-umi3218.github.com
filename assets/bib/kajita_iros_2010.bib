  abstract  = {A novel framework of biped walking stabilization control is introduced. The target robot is a 42 DOF humanoid robot HRP-4C which has a body dimensions close to the average Japanese female. We develop a body posture controller and foot force controllers on the joint position servo of the robot. By applying this posture/force control, we can regard the robot system as a simple linear inverted pendulum with ZMP delay. After a preliminary experiment to confirm the linear dynamics, we design a tracking controller for walking stabilization. It is evaluated in the experiments of HRP-4C walking and turning on a lab floor. The robot can also perform an outdoor walk on an uneven pavement.}
