  abstract  = {In this article, a running humanoid robot, HRP-2LR, was presented along with its running pattern generation, its controller, and the experimental result. Applying the proposed controller, HRP-2LR could successfully run with average speed of 0.16 m/s, repeating flight phases of 0.06 s and support phases of 0.3 s. Future work consists of the realization of faster running and online running pattern generation.},
