  abstract  = {For mobile robots, 3D acquisition is required to model the environment. Particularly for humanoid robots, a modeled environment is necessary to plan the walking control. This environment can include both static objects, such as a ground surface with obstacles, and dynamic objects, such as a person moving around the robot. This paper proposes a system for a robot to obtain a sufficiently accurate shape of the environment for walking on a ground surface with obstacles and a method to detect dynamic objects in the modeled environment, which is necessary for the robot to react to sudden changes in the scene. The 3D acquisition is achieved by a projector-camera system mounted on the robot head that uses a structured-light method to reconstruct the shapes of moving objects from a single frame. The acquired shapes are aligned and merged into a common coordinate system using the simultaneous localization and mapping method. Dynamic objects are detected as shapes that are inconsistent with the previous frames. Experiments were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the 3D acquisition and the robustness with regard to detecting dynamic objects when serving as the vision system of a humanoid robot.}
