  abstract  = {This paper investigates a method to minimize damage to a humanoid robot when it falls over to the ground. The strategy involves controlling the attitude of the robot while it is falling over so that it lands on the ground at one of shock-absorbing parts of the robot. A simulation study has confirmed that the proposed algorithm can make the robot land at specified shock-absorbing parts.}
