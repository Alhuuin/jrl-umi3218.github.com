  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel software that visualizes the physical burden of human body during movements. Its main objective is to support factory workers by monitoring the risk of physical health problems like low back pains. To achieve the goal, the software utilizes wearable sensors like IMUs to realize the measurement at a work-site. Several physical information like joint angles, joint torques, muscle tensions, joint reaction forces can be obtained by real-time musculoskeletal computation. The musculoskeletal information can be plotted and recorded by the visualization interface which is integrated to an ergonomic assessment software DhaibaWorks.}
