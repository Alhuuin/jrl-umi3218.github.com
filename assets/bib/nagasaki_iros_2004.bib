  abstract  = {Aiming for a humanoid robot of the next generation, we have been developing a biped which can jump and run. This paper introduces a method of running pattern generation and running experiment of biped robot HRP-2LR. Based on the physical parameters of HRP-2LR, running patterns are pre-calculated so that it follows the desired profiles of the total linear and angular momentum. For this purpose we used resolved momentum control. The vertical momentum is calculated considering the compliant elements in order to realize accurate flight duration. The horizontal momentum is calculated to satisfy the ZMP patterns given in advance. Using our pattern, HRP-2LR could successfully run with average speed of 0.16[m/s] with repeat flight phase 0.06 [s] and support phase 0.3 [s].}
