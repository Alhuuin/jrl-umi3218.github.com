  abstract  = {A balance control method for a humanoid robot is presented. It consists of a contact torque controller which is designed to have a good backdrivability and a feedback control of the total angular momentum and the center of gravity of a robot. A simulation result of a balance control using a 26 DOF humanoid robot model is shown.}
