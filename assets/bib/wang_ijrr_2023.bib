  abstract  = { Robots usually establish contacts at rigid surfaces with near-zero relative velocities. Otherwise, impact-induced energy propagates in the robot’s linkage and may cause irreversible damage to the hardware. Moreover, abrupt changes in task-space contact velocity and peak impact forces also result in abrupt changes in robot joint velocities and torques; which can compromise controllers’ stability, especially for those based on smooth models. In reality, several tasks would require establishing contact with moderately high velocity. We propose to enhance task-space multi-objective controllers formulated as a quadratic program to be resilient to frictional impacts in three dimensions. We devise new constraints and reformulate the usual ones to be robust to the abrupt joint state changes mentioned earlier. The impact event becomes a controlled process once the optimal control search space is aware of: (1) the hardware-affordable impact bounds and (2) analytically computed feasible set (polyhedra) that constrain post-impact critical states. Prior to and nearby the targeted contact spot, we assume, at each control cycle, that the impact will occur at the next iteration. This somewhat one-step preview makes our controller robust to impact time and location. To assess our approach, we experimented its resilience to moderate impacts with the Panda manipulator and achieved swift grabbing tasks with the HRP-4 humanoid robot. },
