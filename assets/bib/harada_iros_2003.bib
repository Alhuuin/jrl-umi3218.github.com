  abstract  = {This paper newly considers the ZMP (zero moment point) of a humanoid robot under arm/leg coordination. By considering the infinitesimal displacement and the moment acting on the convex hull of the supporting points, we show that our method for determining the region of ZMP can be applicable to several cases of the arm/leg coordination tasks. We first express two kinds of ZMPs for such coordination tasks, i.e., the conventional ZMP, and the "generalized zero moment point (GZMP)" which is a generalization of the ZMP to the arm/leg coordination tasks. By projecting the edges of the convex hull of the supporting points onto the floor, we show that the position and the region of the GZMP for keeping the dynamical balance can be uniquely obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by simulation results.}
