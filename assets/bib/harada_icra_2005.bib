  abstract  = {This paper studies the balance of a humanoid robot carrying a heavy object. Without knowing the mass and the position of the center of gravity of the object, the humanoid robot carries a heavy object stably by using the force sensor information attached at the wrists and the ankles. We first show how to generate the motion of a humamoid robot by taking the force sensor information into consideration. We also show the method for generating the gait pattern by taking the dynamics of the carried object. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experiments.}
