  abstract  = {Cyber space enables us to \textquotedblleft share\textquotedblright  bodies whose movements are a consequence of movements by several individuals. But whether and how our motor behavior is affected during body sharing remains unclear. Here we examined this issue in arm reaching performed by a shared avatar, whose movement was generated by averaging the movements of two participants. We observed that participants exhibited improved reaction times with a shared avatar than alone. Moreover, the reach trajectory of the shared avatar was straighter than that of either participant and correlated with their subjective embodiment of the avatar. Finally, the jerk of the avatar\textquotesingle s hand was less than either participant\textquotesingle s own hand, both when they reached alone and in the shared body. Movement straightness and hand jerk are well known characteristics of human reach behavior, and our results suggest that during body sharing, humans prioritize \ldots },
