  abstract  = {This paper discusses the whole arm manipulation allowing the contact state transition. For manipulation of an object under fully constrained, the contact state transition becomes necessary. In order to realize the object manipulation, we first derive the feasible direction of the object manipulation by analyzing the active/passive closure properties for every combination of contact states. Second, we derive the set of joint torque to move the object in the feasible direction. These analyses also provide the joint torque to realize the manipulation at the planned contact states. Effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by some simulation results}
