  abstract  = {This paper addresses the role of toe joints in increasing the walking speed of biped robots. It is worthy that adding a toe joint will increase the step length thanks to the additional degree of freedom. But, the originality of this work is that longer steps are obtained thanks to an under-actuated phase and an appropriate ZMP trajectory. The simulations showed that adding passive toe joints allows smoother and 1.5 faster walking}
