  abstract  = {This paper presents an advanced leg module developed for HRP-2, a new humanoid robotics platform, which has been developed in phase two of the Humanoid Robotics Project (HRP), a five year program sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) from 1998FY to 2002FY. The biped locomotion ability of HRP-1, the humanoid robotics platform developed in phase I is to be improved so that HRP-2 can cope with rough terrain and can prevent possible damage to the robot body caused by tipping over. In this paper, the mechanisms and specifications of the leg module, the electrical system, the simulation results utilized for deciding specifications, and some experimental results are presented.}
