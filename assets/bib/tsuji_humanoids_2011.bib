  abstract  = {In this paper, we develop a humanoid robot HRP-3\chi  where a multi-fingered hand is attached to the original HRP-3. By installing the visual recognition module for a single camera and the grasp planning module for the multi-fingered hand to the control software, HRP-3\chi  can recognize the position/orientation of the object and can calculate its grasping posture at online. Here, visual recognition module of a single camera is shown to be efficient. The effectiveness of the proposed HRP-3\chi  is confirmed by experimental result in which the robot achieves bipedal walk, visual recognition, and multiple finger grasp.}
