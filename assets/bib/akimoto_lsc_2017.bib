  abstract  = {We describe a simple musculoskeletal model of the lumbosacral spine that is in development for the evaluation of embedded systems in lumbar assist suits. The model is a multiple-link model, reflecting lumbosacral alignment. We also propose a method for optimizing link joint position and evaluate the effect of changing the position.}
