  abstract  = {This paper introduces a visual servoing scheme for humanoid walking. Though most of the existing approaches follow a perception-decision-action scheme, we close the loop so that the control is robust to model error. Our approach is based on a new reactive pattern generator which modifies, at the control level, the footsteps, the center of mass and the center of pressure trajectories for the center of mass to track a reference velocity. And, in this paper, the reference velocity is directly given by a visual servoing control law. Since, the HRP-2 walk induces a sway motion that disturbs the regulation of the visual control law, we introduce a control law allowing convergence in the image space and taking into account this sway motion.}
