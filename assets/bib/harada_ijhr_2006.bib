  abstract  = {This paper studies real-time gait planning for a humanoid robot. By simultaneously planning the trajectories of the COG (Center of Gravity) and the ZMP (Zero Moment Point), a fast and smooth change of gait can be realized. The change of gait is also realized by connecting the newly calculated trajectories to the current ones. While we propose two methods for connecting two trajectories, i.e. the real-time method and the quasi-real-time one, we show that a stable change of gait can be realized by using the quasi-real-time method even if the change of the step position is significant. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are confirmed by simulation and experiment.},
