  abstract  = {In this study, we present a human body shape statistical model including elderly people, which is constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) on 3D body scan data of approximately 130 people. As a pre-process step, a template human body mesh model is fitted to 3D scan data using a coarse-to-fine surface registration technique based on a conformal deformation method, in order to establish correspondences between the scans of different subjects possibly in different poses. To change body style by a small set of parameters, such as "age", "weight" and "height" or the easily measurable anthropometric parameters like "shoulder width", the linear transformations between these attributes and the first 10 principal component scores are obtained. We design a simple user interface to use this deformation model to generate different body styles easily. As a result, we were able to produce and show body styles capturing the characteristics of elderly people whose shoulders fell and back bent. Finally, as an application, we used our deformation method to generate different body types, performed forward dynamics simulations in an assistive device setting and visualized the differences in contact pressure distributions due to body shape changes.}
