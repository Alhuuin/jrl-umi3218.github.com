  abstract  = {Self-reconfigurable robotic systems composed of multiple modules have been investigated inten-sively with respect to their versatility, flexibility, and fault-tolerance. In particular, recent studies examined their feasibility through hardware and software experiments [1]\textendash [6]. Homogeneity enables the system to adapt itself to the external environment by changing its configuration. It can also re-pair itself if some part becomes faulty or damaged, as any module can function as any part in the system. This paper focuses on a micro-sized model of a self-reconfigurable homogeneous modular robot, which opens up many applications, such as inspection robots in hazardous environments or micro-scale simple manipulators. One example of an application is a micro-robot that moves around inside pipes in nuclear or chemical plants by changing its shape, and reorganizes itself as a manipu-lator to execute repairing tasks when it detects some fault as illustrated in Fig. 1. Other applications include a robot that searches for survivors through narrow spaces in buildings destroyed by natu-ral disasters, and also space applications like micro-size planetary exploring robots, solar panels, or satellite antennas. Recently developed lightweight self-reconfigurable modular robots [2, 4, 6] use conventional elec-tromagnetic motors that have limitations in micro-sizing: They become ineffective because the power},
