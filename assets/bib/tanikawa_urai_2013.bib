As a new urban development, a smart community concept has been proposed in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) before the earthquake. That concept aims an integrated and optimized community society with a variety of social services such as an energy, transportation, and logistics system.

The many elderly have lost connection with outside community, because of moving to the temporary housing. And then they become withdrawal condition. Finally, they become bedridden by decline in physical function. These problems are common problem in future aging society in Japan.
