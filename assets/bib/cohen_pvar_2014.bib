  abstract  = {We present a robotic embodiment experiment based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI). In this study, fMRI is used as an input device to identify a subject\textquotesingle s intentions and convert them into actions performed by a humanoid robot. The process, based on motor imagery, has allowed four subjects located in Israel to control a HOAP3 humanoid robot in France, in a relatively natural manner, experiencing the whole experiment through the eyes of the robot. Motor imagery or movement of the left hand, the right hand, or the legs were used to control the robotic motions of left, right, or walk forward, respectively.},
