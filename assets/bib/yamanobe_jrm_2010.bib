  abstract  = {The OpenRT Platform, an integrated development environment for component-based robot system development, is being constructed in order to enhance intelligent robot research and development efficiency. In this paper, a mobile manipulator system that can bring human indicated objects like a service dog is developed based on the OpenRT Platform. The system works with several components providing manipulation, locomotion, and communication functions developed as examples modularizing intelligent robotic functions. These components are integrated using scenario tools in the OpenRT Platform for achieving target tasks.},
