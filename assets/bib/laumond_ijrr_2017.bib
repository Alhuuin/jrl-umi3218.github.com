  abstract  = {The paper reports on two results issued from a multidisciplinary research action exploring the motor synergies of anthropomorphic walking. By combining the biomechanical, neurophysiology, and robotics perspectives, it is intended to better understand human locomotion with the ambition to better design bipedal robot architectures. The motivation of the research starts from the simple observation that humans may stumble when following a simple reflex-based locomotion on uneven terrains. The rationale combines two well established results in robotics and neuroscience, respectively:
passive robot walkers, which are very efficient in terms of energy consumption, can be modeled by a simple rotating rimless wheel;
humans and animals stabilize their head when moving.
The seminal hypothesis is then to consider a wheel equipped with a stabilized mass on top of it as a plausible model of bipedal walking. The two results presented in the paper support the hypothesis.
1. From a motion capture data basis of twelve human walkers, we show that the motions of the feet are organized around a geometric center, which is the center of mass, and is surprisingly not at the hip.
2. After introducing a ground texture model that allows us to quantify the stability performance of walker control schemes, we show how compass-like passive walkers are better controlled when equipped with a stabilized 2-degree-of-freedom moving mass on top of them. The center of mass and head then play complementary roles that define what we call the Yoyo-Man. Beyond the two results presented in the paper, the Yoyo-Man model opens new perspectives to explore the computational foundations of anthropomorphic walking.},
