  abstract  = {Presents the utilization of inertial effect in damping-based posture control of a mobile manipulator. As a measure for redundancy resolution of a mobile manipulator, an effective inertia at the end effector in the operational space is proposed and investigated. By changing the effective inertia property via null-motion, we can get the reduced inertial property of the mobile manipulator. The reduced effective inertia has a significant effect on reducing the impulse force in collision with the environment. To find a posture satisfying both the reduced inertia and joint limit constraints, we propose a combined potential function method which can deal with multiple constraints. The proposed reduced inertia property algorithm is integrated into a damping controller to reduce the impulse force at collision and to regulate the contact force in mobile manipulation.}
