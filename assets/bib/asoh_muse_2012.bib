  abstract  = {Nowadays, people are faced with a huge amount of data, originating from the increasing amount of emails, stored documents, or scientific publications. Just
as people order their CD collection according to genre, sort books on shelves by author, or clothes by colour, it lies in the human nature to structure digital items. This is supported by the directory structure on desktop computers or
tags for bookmarks, photos, and online publications. The structuring of data is a diverse process, and grouping of a set of items into subsets can be seen as
investing it with semantics: a structuring into sets of items, each instantiating a concept. In addition, these concepts depend on each other: One concept is what the other is not; there is meaning not only in assigning an item to a concept, but also
in not assigning it to another concept; and the abstract concepts co-evolve with the assignment of concrete instances to them. This feature makes an analysis of grouping more complex than an analysis just focusing on \textquotedblleft bipartite\textquotedblright  relations
between items and concepts, on the growth of concept vocabulary over time, etc.}
