  abstract  = {This paper presents an advanced leg module developed for HRP-2. HRP-2 is a new humanoid robotics platform,. which we have been developing in phase two of HRP. HRP is a humanoid robotics project, which has been launched by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998FY to 2002FY for five years. The ability of the biped locomotion of HRP-2 is improved so that HRP-2 can cope with rough terrain in the open air and can prevent the possible damages to a humanoid robot\textquotesingle s own self in the event of tipping over. In this paper the mechanisms and specifications of leg module, electrical system, simulation results utilized for deciding specifications, and experimental results are also introduced.}
