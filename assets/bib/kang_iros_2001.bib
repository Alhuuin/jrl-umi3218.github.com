  abstract  = {Deals with the reduced inertial effect in damping-based posture control of a mobile manipulator. As a measure for redundancy resolution of a mobile manipulator, an effective inertia at the end effector in the operational space is proposed and investigated. The reduced effective inertia has a significant effect on reducing the impulse force in collision with environment. To find a posture satisfying both the reduced inertia and joint limit constraints, we propose a combined potential function method that can deal with multiple constraints. The proposed reduced inertia property algorithm is integrated into a damping controller to reduce the impulse force at collision and to regulate the contact force in mobile manipulation. The experimental results show that the reduced inertial effect of the mobile manipulator alleviates the impact force at collision.}
