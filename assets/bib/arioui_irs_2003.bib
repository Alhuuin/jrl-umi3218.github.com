  abstract  = {This paper addresses the stability of time-delayed force-reflecting displays used in virtual reality interactive systems. A novel predictive-like approach is proposed. The developed solution is stable and robust. Neither time delay estimation nor time delay behaviorâ€™s knowledge are required. The controller applies to constant or time-varying delays without any adaptation. In this research, efforts are devoted towards making results easy to implement in commercial haptic libraries and interface build-in controllers. Moreover, although this study focuses on virtual environments haptics, it can easily spreads to force feedback teleoperators Topics: virtual environment haptics, time-delayed force feedback, stability},
