  abstract  = {This paper reports the results of a survey on introducing robots and other new technologies to care services, such as care for older adults. Demographic data show that the ratio of older adults in Japan has already exceeded 23.3\%. Japan also is facing a severe shortage of the working-age population, which could lead to a reduction in the quality of care services for older adults; therefore, robots and the provision of new forms of information technologies are expected to be utilized in such care services. The purpose of this study is to help facilitate the introduction of novel technologies in care services, such as in long-term care facilities. We focus on information-related costs that are incurred prior to the purchase of technologies such as attending exhibitions and conducting Internet searches. This report shows the results of an investigation into such information-related costs for three different products, and discusses the importance of the appropriate management of information costs from the development phase through to the introduction phase of such products.}
