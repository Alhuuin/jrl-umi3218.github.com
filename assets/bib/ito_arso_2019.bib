  abstract  = {In this paper, we introduce a practical contact observer which allows detecting a contact on the body surface of a humanoid robot. Our method estimates the error force due to undesired contact. Then, contact detection (yes/no) is performed together with the estimation of the contact force and location.Bycomparingtherealrobotstateaccordingtosensory data with the desired state computed from the contact-free dynamicsequation,wecanestimatetheexternalforceappliedto anunknownlink.Thelinkincontactisthendetectedbytracing the torque error along the robotâ€™s kinematic chain. Once the link in contact is determined, we can estimate the point where the contact force was applied by using the 3D geometric mesh model of a robot. The proposed method is validated through simulation and experiments using the humanoid robot HRP-4.}
