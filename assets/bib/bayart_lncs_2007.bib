  abstract  = {This paper introduces a concept of augmented reality haptics close to its vision equivalent, namely the blending of information between direct input, measured in the real world, with virtual ones, computed from a VR simulation, related to the explored real world. Hence, we propose blending functions enabling the transition of haptic features, applied for forces and for position switch. Finally, to demonstrate our concept, a tele-operative system dedicated to the tele-touch-diagnosis, is presented and used for scenarios of comparison between real and virtual objects as well as experimental results.},
