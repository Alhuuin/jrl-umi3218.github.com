  abstract  = {For a socially intelligent robot, different levels of situation as-sessment are required, ranging from basic processing of sensor input to high-level analysis of semantics and intention. However, the attempt to combine them all prompts new research challenges and the need of a co-herent framework and architecture. This paper presents the situation assessment aspect of Romeo2, a unique project aiming to bring multi-modal and multi-layered perception on a single system and targeting for a unified theoretical and functional frame-work for a robot companion for everyday life. It also discusses some of the innovation potentials, which the combination of these various perception abilities adds into the robot\textquotesingle s socio-cognitive capabilities.}
