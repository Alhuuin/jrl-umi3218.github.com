  abstract  = {This paper proposes an whole body motion planning method for humanoid robots in which dynamics is integrated. The method consists of two stages. A collision-free and statically stable path is planned in the first stage and it is transformed into a dynamically stable trajectory in the second stage. Contributions of the method is summarized as follows. (1) A local method plans a C 1 path while avoiding collisions between non-strictly convex objects. (2) The second stage gives the minimum time trajectory by time parameterization under dynamic balance constraints. (3) Any path reshaping for recovering collision-freeness is not required since the second stage doesnpsilat change shape of the path. Effectiveness of the method is examined by applying it to scenarios of a humanoid robot HRP-2.}
