  abstract  = {This paper proposes a universal stability criterion of the foot contact of legged robots. The proposed method checks if the sum of the gravity and the inertia wrench applied to the COG of the robot, which is proposed to be the stability criterion, is inside the polyhedral convex cone of the contact wrench between the feet of a robot and its environment. The criterion can be used to determine the strong stability of the foot contact when a robot walks on an arbitrary terrain and/or when the hands of the robot are in contact with it under the sufficient friction assumption. The determination is equivalent to check if the ZMP is inside the support polygon of the feet when the robot walks on a horizontal plane with sufficient friction. The criterion can also be used to determine if the foot contact is sufficiently weakly stable when the friction follows a physical law. Therefore, the proposed criterion can be used to judge what the ZMP can, and it can be used in more universal cases}
