  abstract  = {We previously reported the first human-sized humanoid robot that can fall down safely and stand up again. This paper examines the falling motion control by supplementary simulations and presents an improvement of the control by optimizing the control parameters. The UKEMI falling over control of a human-sized humanoid robot is simulated, the simulation results are compared with the experimental results of real humanoid robot.}
