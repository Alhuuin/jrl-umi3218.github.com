The Humanoid Lab is a part of the CNRS-AIST JRL, located at AIST, Tsukuba about 5km from the main campus of the University of Tsukuba.
It is associated to the university through the Cooperative Graduate School System, which means that graduate students at the university
can work at JRL as Trainees and RAs under the supervision of Prof. Kanehiro (Faculty of Cooperative Graduate School, IMIS).

The lab provides a unique opportunity for graduate students to work with Japanese and foreign research scientists on a
wide variety of robot platforms and research topics. Our main research subjects include: task and motion planning and control, multimodal interaction
with human and surrounding environment through perception, and cognitive robotics.
