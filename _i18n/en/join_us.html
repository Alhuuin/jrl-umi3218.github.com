	  Students can be hosted at JRL as technical trainees and excellent master/PhD students can be hired as <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/collab/ra/index.html">a research assistant of AIST</a>. Although students from any universities can do their internships at JRL, students from the following universities can do their thesis at JRL under supervision of researchers of JRL.<br>
	  <ul>
	    <li style="margin-top: 1em"><b>University of Tsukuba: </b><br>
	      Since some JRL members are adjunct professors of <a href="https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/">University of Tsukuba</a>, master and PhD students can do their thesis by enrolling at University of Tsukuba and doing research work at JRL. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/humanoid_lab.html">Humanoid Laboratory</a> is a laboratory of University of Tsukuba hosted by JRL using <a href="https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/academics/g-courses-cooperative/">Cooperative Graduate School System</a>.

	      PhD students of <a href="https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/">University of Montpellier</a> can do their thesis at JRL. The JRL is the only one laboratory outside of France where PhD students of University of Montpellier can do their PhD thesis.
	    </li>
	    <li style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Other French universities: </b><br>
	      Students from some other French universities can also do a part of their Ph.D. thesis at JRL. Please don't hesitate to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact.html">contact</a> us for more details.
